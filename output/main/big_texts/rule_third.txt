GENERALIZATION

In order to make it easier for you to remember
in which case which preposition to use, we will repeat
once again their main functions.
The preposition at is used when we call the
exact time (at which time the action took place).
We use the preposition on in English when we talk
about a specific day (day of the week, date, holiday).
The preposition in in English is used for large
time periods (month, season, year, etc.).
